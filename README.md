# Daily Schedule Challenge

## Description

In this challenge I utalized jQuery to traverse the DOM and to select multiple siblings of elements. When the user enters an input into one of the time block fields and clicks the save button, their input is saved to local storage and will persist when the user refreshes the page. The time blocks will change color depending on that time block being in the past, present or future. I used an if else statement to change the class of each time block. The current date and time will be displayed at the top of the page via DayJS. The daily schedule can be cleared by using the application tab in the Chrome Developer Tool.

## Technologies Used
